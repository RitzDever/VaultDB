#**Vault - Abstraction Library for Bukkit**

###*For Developers:*

Please see the VaultAPI page for information on developing with Vault's API. In the past you would use the same artifact as servers installed, but the API has now been split from the main project and is under a different artifact name. Please make sure you accomodate for this change in your build process.

###*Installing*

Installing VaultDB is as simple as copying the provided "Vault.jar" to your "/plugins" directory and the rest is automatic! 
Make sure you have Vault installed as well, since this plugin is an addon for it :P
